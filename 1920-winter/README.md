# Deep Learning Seminar, Winter 2019/20

## Tab: Home

In recent years, **deep neural networks** have been used to solve complex
machine-learning problems and have achieved significant **state-of-the-art**
results in **many** areas. The whole field of deep learning has been developing
**rapidly**, with **new methods** and **techniques** emerging steadily.

The goal of the seminar is to follow the **newest advancements** in the deep
learning field. The course takes form of a **reading group** – each lecture
a paper is presented by one of the students. The paper is announced in advance,
hence all participants can read it beforehand and can take part in the
**discussion of the paper**.

If you want to receive announcements about chosen paper, sign up to our
[mailing list ufal-rg@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ufal-rg).
